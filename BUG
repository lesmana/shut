bug: goodshut reports all pass even if there are fails.

bug occurs when subshells are changed to command groups.

before:
  ((((((
  runtests >&6; echo $? >&7
  ) 3>&1 | count >&3
  ) 4>&1 | count >&4
  ) 5>&1 | count >&5
  ) 3>&1 4>&1 5>&1 | summaryline >&6
  ) 7>&1 | stdintoexitstatus
  ) 6>&1

after:
  {{{{{{
  runtests >&6; echo $? >&7
  } 3>&1 | count >&3
  } 4>&1 | count >&4
  } 5>&1 | count >&5
  } 3>&1 4>&1 5>&1 | summaryline >&6
  } 7>&1 | stdintoexitstatus
  } 6>&1

goodshut is not modified. only shut is modified.

note: commands groups need whitespace around braces.

wrong: {{foo}}
correct: { { foo } }

using command groups without spaces causes syntax error.
the group of opening braces are treated as a command.
the closing braces are dangling because there are no opening braces.

but why does this mess up goodshut?
goodshut should report all fail. instead it reports all pass.
