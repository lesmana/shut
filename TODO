todo for shell unit test

----
local all the variables

----
test that all or most errors are handled.

----
test that pattern argument works with absolute and relative path

----
read testnames from stdin

----
always delete shutdir by default but only if it is
recognized as created by shut
how? let shut put relatively unique marker in shutdir

----
provide option to not create shutdir
work in temp directory instead

----
add option to allow no tests found to be no error

----
in output replace long paths with variables
for example
/home/lesmana/code/shellunittest/tests/shutdir/bla
replace with
$SHUTDIR/bla

----
write help and readme

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
forced fail for tests which take longer than x seconds
use command timeout

----
decide whether quiet should be really quiet (no output at all)
or just not print test output but still print summary (as is now)

----
specify in output if last x lines
example:
output (last 10 lines)

----
specify in output if empty
example
stderr: (empty)
