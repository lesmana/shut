todo for shell unit test

----
restructure some code
let find print to two files
first file containing relative names
second file containing absolute names
for humans print relative names
to execute use absolute names

to determine if tests found check if files empty
this means every invocation creates files
workaround for now is to always create shutdir
maybe later create shutdir in tmp first and move over if needed

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
print stdout and stderr of test separately

----
pattern argument
if pattern is dir recurse in to dir
if pattern is file run file
if pattern is neither then search for files matching pattern

----
read testnames from stdin

----
create shutdir only when tests are actually run
first find tests
if no action then just print names and exit
if no tests found then complain and exit
else try to create shutdir and run tests
if shutdir exists then complain or overwrite

----
skip shutdir when looking for tests
