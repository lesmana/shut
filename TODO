todo for shell unit test

----
redirect party

from actual runtest
redirect stdout to 3, stderr to 4
capture exitstatus and print to file and to 1
capture output from 3 and 4 and print to file

after test
print report to 3
print error to 4

immediately before runtests loop
catch errors from 4 and 2 and print to 2
catch reports from 3 and print to 1
catch exitstatus from 1 and report to loop

why the trouble?
actual exitstatus is free to report error
actual stderr is free to report error
test exitstatus can be captured using $()

----
all echo to printf
printf with explicit format string to guard against accidental % expansion

----
test that pattern argument works with absolute and relative path

----
read testnames from stdin

----
add option to always try to delete existing shutdir

----
when deciding whether existing shutdir is safe to delete
examine contents and look for files: tests pass fail

----
provide option to not create shutdir
work in temp directory instead

----
add option to allow no tests found to be no error

----
in output replace long paths with variables
for example
/home/lesmana/code/shellunittest/tests/shutdir/bla
replace with
$SHUTDIR/bla

----
add option to abort runtests loop if fail or error

----
allow exluding tests

----
provide option to show non executables which match given pattern
to help find tests which were mistakenly not marked executable

----
write help and readme

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
forced fail for tests which take longer than x seconds
use command timeout

----
provide options to fine tune output
example
--print-all-reports
--print-list-of-fail
--print-list-of-pass
--print-summary

----
allow pattern for line to begin printing output
example
--show-output=10 (show last 10 lines)
--show-output=diff (show lines after line containing diff)

----
specify in output if last x lines
example:
output (last 10 lines)

----
specify in output if empty
example
stderr: (empty)

----
recreate report from existing shutdir without rerunning tests
