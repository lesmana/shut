todo for shell unit test

----
local all the variables

----
test that all or most errors are handled.
inject errors using manipulated mktemp.
mktemp is always called and is one of the first things shut does.
mktemp can create directories and files so that
later mkdir or cd or redirect attempts will fail.

----
test that pattern argument works with absolute and relative path

----
read testnames from stdin

----
always delete shutdir by default but only if it is
recognized as created by shut
how? let shut put relatively unique marker in shutdir

----
always create temp directory
provide option to not create shutdir
work in temp directory instead
always delete temp directory at end

----
write help and readme

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
forced fail for tests which take longer than x seconds
use command timeout

----
decide whether quiet should be really quiet (no output at all)
or just not print test output but still print summary (as is now)

----
specify in output if last x lines
example:
output (last 10 lines)

----
specify in output if empty
example
stderr: (empty)
