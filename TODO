todo for shell unit test

----
restructure some code

    find tests save to tempfile
    test is file not empty?
      runtest
    else
      error exit no tests found
    end if
    return exit status from execute or from error exit

runtest code:

    test is do action?
      delete existing shutdir and ignore error if not exists
      copy/move tempfile to shutdir
      cd to shutdir
      execute action
    else
      execute noaction with tempfile
    endif

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
print stdout and stderr of test separately

----
only print last x lines from test output

----
pattern argument
if pattern is dir recurse in to dir
if pattern is file run file
if pattern is neither then search for files matching pattern

----
read testnames from stdin

----
create shutdir only when tests are actually run
first find tests
if no action then just print names and exit
if no tests found then complain and exit
else try to create shutdir and run tests
if shutdir exists then complain or overwrite

----
skip shutdir when looking for tests
