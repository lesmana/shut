todo for shell unit test

----
prepare file descriptors connected to pass and fail in runtests
let later functions use file descriptors to write to pass and fail directly
the loop in runtests should only prepare the fds and then run the tests
(and close the fds)

----
remove exitstatus between runtestandprintreport and runtests
this is most likely done using the file descriptors

----
between runtests and runtestintestdir
add another function monitoring exitstatus
if zero do nothing
else capture stderr and print error report

----
local all the variables

----
handle error rm tempdir

----
test that pattern argument works with absolute and relative path

----
in runtests handle fail and error separately

----
read testnames from stdin

----
add option to always try to delete existing shutdir

----
when deciding whether existing shutdir is safe to delete
examine contents and look for files: tests pass fail

----
provide option to not create shutdir
work in temp directory instead

----
add option to allow no tests found to be no error

----
in output replace long paths with variables
for example
/home/lesmana/code/shellunittest/tests/shutdir/bla
replace with
$SHUTDIR/bla

----
allow exluding tests

----
provide option to show non executables which match given pattern
to help find tests which were mistakenly not marked executable

----
write help and readme

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
forced fail for tests which take longer than x seconds
use command timeout

----
provide options to fine tune output
example
--print-all-reports
--print-list-of-fail
--print-list-of-pass
--print-summary

----
allow pattern for line to begin printing output
example
--show-output=10 (show last 10 lines)
--show-output=diff (show lines after line containing diff)

----
specify in output if last x lines
example:
output (last 10 lines)

----
specify in output if empty
example
stderr: (empty)

----
recreate report from existing shutdir without rerunning tests
