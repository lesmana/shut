todo for shell unit test

----
restructure some code
let find print to two files
first file containing relative names
second file containing absolute names
for humans print relative names
to execute use absolute names

to determine if tests found check if files empty
this means every invocation creates files
workaround for now is to always create shutdir
maybe later create shutdir in tmp first and move over if needed

----
create logfile of entire stdout of shut

----
print stdout and stderr of test separately

----
recognize more than one pattern argument
shut pat1 pat2
will find files matching pat1 or pat2

----
read testnames from stdin
